  Thank you for opening this pull request, your code will be reviewed soon! 
  
  Important Notes:
  
  
  There is a limit to the number of pull requests you can make on this project due to the large amount of activity. Please limit yourself to up to 4 additions to this project. (Example: Complete 1 feature and add three movies, complete 4 Issues for movies and add one feature, add four movies, etc). Some Issues ask that you add mulitple shows/movies, that will count as 1 addition. The limit will be removed in the future but for now I want to allow as many people as possible to have the chance contribute.
