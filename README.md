* [Find an Issue](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/issues) that you would like to complete. 
* If someone is already assigned an Issue, please move on to another Issue. If the Issue has not been assigned, comment inside of the Issue stating that you would like to work on that item. 
* Wait for confirmation from the maintainers before working on the Issue. 
* After you receive confirmation, complete the Issue and submit a Pull Request.

If someone is assigned an Issue and doesn't complete it after a while, we will open the Issue to everyone else again.

If you would like to suggest a new feature, create [an Issue](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/issues) and outline what it is you think should be added or updated. Wait for confirmation before working on the Issue. 

### Adding a Movie, TV show or Musical

To add a show or movie to this project, you will need to add an `Emoji Card` inside of the `data.js` file. The `data.js` file is made up of an array (a list) of objects. You will add a new object for your show. 

If you need help choosing a movie or show, [check the Issues](https://github.com/brittanyrw/emojiscreen/labels/add%20emojis).

Below is an example of what a show looks like on the website:

![Screenshot of Beauty and the Beast Emoji Card](/readme/emoji-card.png)

In the `data.js` file, each `Emoji Card` consists of the following object:

```
{
  title: "Beauty and the Beast",
  emojiImgs: "🏰🥀🎶📚🕰️",
  genres: ["animation", "family", "fantasy"],
  itemLink: "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/",
  type: "movie",
  year: 1991
}
```

## Required reading:
View the [Card Overview](/docs/card_overview.md) for details on each part of the emoji object.
